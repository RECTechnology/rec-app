# Views

**Views** are a set of widgets and other views, and high level logic.

#### For example the **Login** would contain:
* Logo
* Title
* Description
* Login Form (is a kind of view in itself)
* Aditional link (signup, forgot pass, etc...)

> It will also contain the logic for how those widgets interact with each other
