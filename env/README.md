Create a folder for each whitelabel project, they must hold `.env` files for each supported environment in this format: `<env_name>.env`

For example in the `rec` folder these files must be created from `.env-dist` and filled with the appropriate environment variables.

* `pre.env`
* `prod.env`
* `sandbox.env`

The same must be done for each project
